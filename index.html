In 1948, Nasipit was still a part of the parish of Buenavista, whose parish priest was the late Fr. Martin Westeinde, a Dutch MSC. As the town progressed, population also increased and business gained momentum with the start of the logging industry of Nasipit Lumber Company (NALCO). Fr Martin and his co-adjutor Fr. Atanacio de Castro saw the need of putting up a secondary school. Fr. De Castro was placed in charge of the school.

It started its operation on July 1, 1948, with Rev. Fr. Francisco Van Dyke as the first director. He was succeeded by Rev. Fr. Geraldo Blewanus, Rev. Fr. Enrique Van Ma-anen, Rev. Fr.
